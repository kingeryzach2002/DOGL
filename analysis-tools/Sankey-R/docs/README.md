# SANKEY GRAPH IN R
Super barebones application of a d3 framework in R. Not publishable but useful for exploratory analysis.

## Functionality and Features
- Can build a Sankey graph out of a json file with nodes and links

## Data and Required Packages
- Json data in the form provided by the csv-to-json converter (*sankey_data.json*)
- Open in RStudio - necessary packages: networkd3, jsonlite

## Tasks and Open Issues
- Add an RStudio environment with the required packages preinstalled.
- Same issue as everywhere else where I want to have a predefined path to the data if possible.
- Otherwise, this is totally usable for exploratory analysis but not customizable enough to publish.
